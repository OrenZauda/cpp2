# Binary Search Tree cpp

Task 2 is designed to train us in writing departments, building and dismantling,
memory management, error handling, and especially writing tests.

## Usage

We got a number of functions that we needed to realize such as:
remove,insert,contains,size. and the goal is to run tests which the code will run and check that everything worked and compile.

### Examples

Tests:

```c++
  .CHECK_EQUAL (emptytree.size(), 0)
  .CHECK_OK    (emptytree.insert(5))
  .CHECK_EQUAL (emptytree.size(), 1)
  .CHECK_EQUAL (emptytree.contains(5), true)
```
After we run the program we need to get an instent grade.
